project describtion :Machine Learning-multiclassification problem using dataset-DUMD
## Problem: 
The objective of this project is to solve a multiclassification problem using SVM model and 
perceptron model, using One Versus Rest (OVR) SVM, use argmax to aggregate the confidence 
score, obtain the final predicted labels, measure the performance of the model, and apply One 
Versus One (OVO) SVM.
